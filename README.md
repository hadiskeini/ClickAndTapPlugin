# Click and Tap Plugin for OpenTabletDriver

A plugin for OpenTabletDriver that enhances tablet input functionality by providing a click and tap funcitonality, as is known from official Wacom drivers.

If you intend to use your tablet as a mouse replacement for general computing, I also recommend using https://github.com/hadiskeini/ClickStabilizerPlugin.

## Features

- **Tap Support**: Enables tap-to-click functionality for (currently) two pen buttons defined in the Pen Settings 
- **Drag Support**: Maintains click state during drag operations
